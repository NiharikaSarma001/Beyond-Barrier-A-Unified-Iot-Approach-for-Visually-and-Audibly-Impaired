# Smart Glass for Visually Impaired
## Project Description
This project aims to develop a smart glass prototype equipped with various sensors to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings safely. The smart glass integrates sensors for gas detection, fire detection, ultrasonic object detection, and fall detection. Additionally, it connects to a companion mobile app via Bluetooth to provide audible alerts whenever potential hazards are detected. The system also includes a software component for interactive Morse code translation, allowing users to input and translate Morse code messages into plain text, with an option to have them spoken aloud. Moreover, there's a feature enabling non-disabled users to communicate with the visually impaired user via speech-to-text conversion.
